                  I will present the benefits of assembling a computer yourself,
                  the power of a brand and why iMac Pro is just not a rational
                  decision anymore. We all love beautiful design, but to create
                  one, we need the best tool for the job, not the sleekest.</p>

        <p class="bodyText">May 2006, Apple releases a series of ads called “Get a Mac”. It is two men where one is potrayed as a PC and the other as a Mac. PC is dressed in a suit and a tie with glasses, while Mac could be defined as being dressed more casual. The ads run from 2006-2009 and depicts various situations how Mac is better. In the very first episode called Better is where Mac admits PC is good at business stuff like spreadsheets, while he’s better at lifestyle stuff like photos, music, and movies. Lifestyle being the keyword here.</p>
        <p class="bodyText">On the Apple side you have cool, trendy and innovative Steve Jobs, the underdog. On the other side you have geeky, bad dressing Bill Gates, with his overwhelming huge business. One represents  design, creativity and imagination, while the other speaks to functionality, usefulness and business. It doesn’t make a difference how good or cool looking the Microsoft computer is, the point at which they compete is in a very visual category where products have moved toward becoming accesories, not tools. A lifestyle computer user does not purchase the product for it’s usefulness, but more for its self-expressive advantages, it’s brand image, and status of creativity that comes with the Apple product. </p>

        <p class="bodyText">December 14, 2017 Apple releases their flagship computer advertised as
the most powerful Mac ever made, with all the other great marketing tools
that have allowed them to create this tradition and legacy that people have
forgotten to question for what it really is and do they even need it.
Together with the new iMac Pro they also released visually appealing trailer for
the new computer. The new iMacs were given to a few artists to define the power
through the films they make and to showcase the fact that Mac indeed is a tool
for creatives. The work showcased in the movies is amazing, but if we pay close
attention we can see some sequences come with a gray disclaimer noting that
there is additional equipment used for final renders of some sequences.
The additional equipment is not defined, nor that it matters more than just the
pure fact that the most powerful Mac together with rest of the Apple products,
maybe is just not the right choice for a creative professionals anymore.
I have been studying graphic design for almost four years now, and have been in some
way or another connected to arts and creative field for more than 8 years, during these
years I have been developing my view on the world as a critical designer and as human
being. Learned to question things and not take anything for granted. Although with that
in mind, only recently I have been paying close attention to the main tool in creative
field today – computer and for multiple reasons have chosen to be in control of my
working tool by building it myself and not just giving in to the convention of Apple.</p>

        <p class="bodyText">Being a kid, in my family, we always had desktop PC’s, later one special Christmas evening
my parents got me my first personal computer, which was meant for school, but was mostly
used for games by me, at that time I had no doubts about windows OS or interest in Apple
products. Later on I developed interest for art and design and I got admitted in a highschool
with a specialization in fine arts and multimedia. In my art school there were iMac
desktop computers available in the media room so that is the point where I understood that
I need an apple computer, without even putting much more thought about specifications of the
computer or why, but It just seemed to be the tool to use when becoming/being a graphic
designer – which is total nonsense looking back at it now! Also at the time of writing this
thesis from Royal Academy of Arts, which is exclusively equipped with Apple computers.
So there definitely is, even if I just talk from my own experience, this additional pressure for
young people getting into arts and design, seeing in movies, schools and where not, creative
and cool things happen with an apple computer. If we just do a simple google image search
of keywords like designer at work or graphic design studio we get images like this:</p>

         <p class="bodyText">After using my macbook pro for 4 years for my graphic design related task I found myself
developing in-depth interest in using 3D software to broaden the posibilities of my creations.
I found myself doing some simple models on my laptop and iMac at school but found it to be
very inefficient, because the learning curve is very slow if every action you do is calculated
for couple of seconds or minutes and after that you realize that is not how you wanted it to be
at all, so working on iMac or my macbook pro at the time was even a bit off putting to say the
least, as it was so slow, and i am not even talking about rendering image in proper resolution
of any kind or animation longer than few seconds which would be basically impossible. 
I understood that I need a new stationary desktop computer that would be my main working tool
as designer and content creator, and would last me for a while. So I was ready for an investment
in my future and of course I had heard that Apple had released their new generation iMac
Pro. I was very excited until I saw the price tag of the base model which at the moment of writing is 5,497.91 euros. I am not going to go into specifications in this chapter and leave it for comparisons in the chapter called Proffessional power, but for that price and specifications offered it is not a rational decision taking into account there is no customizability, so when the hardware gets outdated that is it, you need to buy a new iMac, and the hardware offered there very will could be outdated in the next 2 years, taking into account the computer hardware technology development speed, especially the graphic cards industry which is the most fast advancing technology of computer science in history due to high demand in game industry.<br><br>
To put in perspective the speeds of these advancements we can take an example of Moores law proposed by Gordon Moore in 1965 which he showed that the number of components per
intergrated circuit was doubling every year and has been doing that till this day for computer
processors, then graphics cards have been evolving at a rate of thousand times every 10 years
starting with worlds first graphics card GeForce 256 in 1999. In the Keynote presentation
of Geforce RTX graphics card Jensen Huang states that at the current rate of development
it would takes approximately ten more years to reach real-time ray-tracing technology, but
thanks to machine learning denoising posibilities, the real time ray-tracing is already available.

       <p class="bodyText">Now that I have assembled my main tool as a graphic designer, I can take the advantages that
the hardware of my computer together with latest software can offer. I can be efficient and
quick in rendering and learning and/or experimenting without my tool getting into the way of
my initial thoughts or possible outcomes. I have regained the control of the process. Since I
have personalized the computer’s hardware to my needs, the thought process for creating
work has changed for me. I no longer think through what the computer can do for me, of course
reasonably I think through my knowledge, but what I mean is, I can start with what I want to
make without worrying that, for example, that the polygon count will be too high to handle for
my computer or the animation render will take way too long to finish the work on time. I feel
I have that extra room with a higher ceiling that just lets your thoughts flow without limiting
yourself by some external features limiting me as a creator. Marshall McLuhan states that the book is the extension of the eye, in my case the computer is the extension of mind. Nothing is limitless, and I am not writing science-fiction here and I have even caught myself getting too used to its smoothness
and dreaming about it getting even more powerful, but then I remember it is actually possible.</p>

but actually, if the goal is not to reach extreme levels of overclocking it is possible to
make these changes even in the manufactures provided software.

As the image above shows, I am able to enter OC mode which stands for Overclocked mode
for my graphics card. I enter this mode every time I need to render something, I do not have
to, but I can, it gives a slight boost to the performance which means I lower my render times
even more than original. This OC mode is preconfigured with necessary voltage so you would
not run in any problems, with proper cooling and knowledge it is possible to overclock parts
like processor and graphics card to even much higher frequencies than the preconfigured
overclock setup. This just shows how much more control a customized PC can offer to a
professional in comparison to Apple computers where due limited space and therefore limited
thermal solutions overclocking would just cause overheating and damage your system.

        <p class="bodyText">Graphic design has always been a reflection of the technology of the current times. The computer revolutionized the design process 20 years ago, but it keeps going. The days that graphic designer is only focused on obvious graphic elements like logos, packaging and posters are gone. With the current overtake of technology and digital media, and the internet being a major tool of distribution, communication, and exposure for brands, digital content creation is a must. The world is making everything even more instantaneous. It won’t be long before people are using Virtual Reality to demo a product and then immediately wanting it 3D printed to their specifications. 3D Virtual prototyping allows brands like Nike, Adidas etc. to test their products before creating tedious factory metal molds that could take weeks for a product that maybe is a failure. The possibilities of prototyping allow the companies to test their assumptions with users and gather feedback while a design is evolving before it is even manufactured, which is a massive economic and also ecological advantage.</p>

       	 <p class="bodyText">Sucuk und Bratwurst, a creative studio based in Mainz,Germany, recently has been gaining world wide recognition through their sharp 3D work, steadily growing and working for clients like Nike, Alexander Wang, Post Malone and when asked about if 3D graphics is here for a stay, or just a trend like processing was years ago, answers that“ 3D, in general, will stay with graphic design for a while now because it is simply such a versatile tool. Photography went hand in hand with graphic design since forever and now that 3D gives you photorealistic results that’s just the way to go.” During my internship at graphic design studio Parallel Practice we were working with 3D graphics in a way that it does not look like a 3D render, but is used as a tool of achieving certain vision. Although our working tool at the moment was Apple iMac computers, it occured to us many times we should switch to custom PC made for the purpose we need, especially when it comes to moving 3D image. Parallel Practice is certain that certain skill in 3D will become a necessity in near future for graphic designers.</p>

        <p class="bodyText">Contemporary Graphic Design finds itself becoming a very interdisciplinary platform of creation, and within this platform people have learned to use 3D in their own unique ways. 3D designer, artist Ada Sokol, has defined clear borders for herself and her practice. For her, graphic design is everything that is “2d”, does not have a dimension or has only 3D effects on 2D layers. She is using 3D in a very pure way, every object on her scene is in three dimensions, has assigned particular material and if the camera would get rotated from the given scene, it could be captured as in real life. Although working mostly for clients, she does not associate herself as a graphic designer at all. When starting her practice, Ada also started on a Apple computer, but quickly switched to self-built windows computer due to lack of customization. Now Ada has two self-built computer  that are created exactly for her needs, although no specifications details were given to me, as it is a secret.</p>

        <p class="bodyText">3D graphics, in general, is a new field that is expanding by the day, the tech is getting better and so are the software and with that also
        the techniques and new uses are discovered every day.  If we go back to graphic design which is actually seen as mostly 2d practice or
        you could say 3D graphics that are presented on a 2D surface, it is up to the designer himself to find new  ways that 3D graphics could
        be integrated in(currently 2d) based practice and push his design practice to next level implementing new technologies and staying up
        to date with new possibilities. In my experience, one  of the latest, most profound uses that I have taken  part in myself was during my
        internship at Parallel Practice where we used 3D in  type design.</p>

        <p class="bodyText">Parallel Practice at the time was working on a new identity for an Academy of Fine Arts, Prague (AVU). The idea was to take Jiri
        Kovandas, who is an important Czech artistand alumni  from AVU, the typewriter that heused to write the description with, forimages
        with his performances from the 70s and 80s.We started with the physical object, thetypewriter itself, and we proceeded to scanit with a
        dental 3D scanner, which gave us more than10 million  polygon resolution. Dental fieldis also embracing the 3d technologiesnowadays,
        because of 3d scanners and printers designedspecifically for dental applications can nowhelp  dentists offer a more personalizedservice
        to patients, for example, directmanufacturing of  dental crown, implants orany other dental appliances  by easilycapturing their patients
        denture in 3d with high accuracy. As amatter of fact, the typewriter lettersplacement from close up looks like a mouthwith teeth a bit.</p>

        <p class="bodyText">With the 3d scan of the actual letters from the machine, we continued to work in 3D software. The first step was a formal separation of
        each glyph in a separate file for easier workflow. Next step, was to start modeling the letter from the original surface by underlying a
        plane under the glyph and then by moving point in the  plane we could regulate the desired thickness of the letter shape.</p><br>
        <p class="bodyText">
        This process was the ultimate 2D 3Dexperience,  because when modeling theletters in blender and getting the shaperight, we were
        working with diffused materials, so you justsee white and black, which looks flat, butactually is not.  Later on we screenshotedeach
        individual glyph from Blender and wherenecessary  adjusted in illustrator. In thismethod 3D allowed us, first of all, workquick with
        getting the forms fast, but more importantlyit kept the link between the originalmachine and us. That is  the additionalvalue that could
        goes missing just by tracing letters typedon a piece  of paper. As Hilde Bouchez inher book A Wild Thing  says:“There are wildthings
        and there are tame things” I would call thisapproach  a wild practice to type design.</p>

        <p class="bodyText">My initial reasoning for building my own computer was very formal, it was a simple financial matter, I wanted to save some money. After doing some research and realizing the performance I expect from my working tool, I knew I could build a computer as good or even better than iMac Pro for half the price. But what I have gained through this process is much more than just saving me more than 3 thousand euros.<br><br>

By focusing on the consumption of a convention for several years, we have lost a link to our tools. A tool that we do not understand or has a hidden side or worse, an unknowable side, is a foreign object that we can not call our working tool. We can not rely till the end of the time on Apple Geniuses as the mages of computer science. PC building has become very modular nowadays, the actual assembly is as hard or a bit harder than putting together a lego set when you get the hang of it. Currently, all the work I do in some way or another is connected with using my computer, thereby knowing the hardware ins and outs and the software that comes with them is directly linked in how well I can work with this tool. It has become a matter of exploring more and wanting to understand even in more depth the processes that are going on by my side all day long. Everything is intertwined with each other, so by learning the tool – computer in a pragmatic way, I am able to gain insight into all the related processes as well. <br><br>

By choosing this path I am able to influence the nature of my tool and shift in the path that the world is going for, at the time of writing it is the 3D industry takeover. And it is definitely for here to stay and grow, and ask for more power. It has again proven to me that creativity starts with exploration and defying conventions and getting out of your set of comfort. Being fluid and adapting constantly to events in the world and not being ignorant but honest to your profession as a graphic designer and maybe even take some pride in the fact that you have built your own workspace.(mic drop)</p>
